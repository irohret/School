        "* Second, download the notebook in .ipynb format (File > Download .ipynb) and upload the .ipynb file to [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSekLbdR8sFpJsnJln-MNpn8rKYi8jKv5uFfBYTdRXyQpriS3w/viewform?usp=sf_link).\n",

        "\n",
        "* **If you are inactive too long, your notebook might get disconnected from the back-end.** Your work is never lost, but you have to re-run all the cells before you continue. \n",
        "\n",
        "* You can write out print statements in your code, to help you test/debug it. But remember: the code is graded on the basis of what it outputs or returns, not on the basis of what it prints.\n",
