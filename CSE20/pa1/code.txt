# This program allows you find the volume and surface area of a sphere based on the radius you input into the system

# store all given input in variable (radius)
radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the sphere: "))

# calculate the volume of the sphere
a = 4 / 3
b = math.pi

# calculate the surface area of a sphere

x = 4
y = math.pi

# output

sphere = (a * b * radius**3)
volume_of_the_sphere = (x * y * radius**2)

print("The volume is:",sphere)
print("The surface area is:",volume_of_the_sphere)
